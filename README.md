# Scalable Cloud Architecture for E-Commerce Application

This project presents a scalable, cloud-native architecture designed to support an e-commerce application capable of handling **millions of global requests** efficiently and cost-effectively.

---

## üìå Overview

The system is designed to:

- Handle **read and write APIs** independently and at scale.
- Support **background processing** for long-running or heavy data tasks.
- Integrate with **external systems** for product data.
- Serve **globally distributed users** with varying traffic peaks.
- Maintain **cost-efficiency** with serverless and autoscaling components.

## üåê Architecture Components

### 1. **Load Balancer + CDN**
- A global load balancer routes requests to the nearest region, improving latency.
- A Content Delivery Network (CDN) caches static assets and product media for rapid delivery.

### 2. **Web Frontend**
- Hosted using object storage (e.g., S3 or Azure Blob) behind the CDN.
- Supports SSR or SPA (React, Angular, etc.) optimized for performance.

### 3. **API Gateway**
- Manages routing for read/write APIs.
- Provides authentication, throttling, and monitoring.

### 4. **Microservices**
- Containerized microservices deployed via Kubernetes or Fargate/Cloud Run.
- Dedicated services for `Orders`, `Users`, `Payments`, etc.

### 5. **Databases**
- **Relational DB** (SQL Server/PostgreSQL/MySQL) with read replicas for order, user, and payment data.
- **NoSQL** (DynamoDB, CosmosDB) for catalog and cart management.
- Supports horizontal and vertical scaling as needed.

### 6. **Caching Layer**
- Redis/Memcached to cache frequently accessed product data and sessions.
- Reduces DB load and improves response times.

### 7. **Background Job Processing**
- SQS/Kafka/RabbitMQ/Azure Service Bus + Worker Pods or Serverless Functions for:
  - External product sync.
  - Inventory updates.
  - Report generation.
  - Email/SMS sending
  - Notification system

### 8. **Message Queue**
- Decouples synchronous and asynchronous operations.
- Ensures scalability and fault tolerance in job processing.

### 9. **Monitoring & Logging**
- Cloud-native monitoring tools (e.g., CloudWatch, Stackdriver, Azure Monitor) for system health, metrics, and logs.
- Alerts set for system anomalies or threshold breaches.

## üîÑ Scalability & Cost Optimization

- **Auto-scaling groups** for dynamic resource provisioning.
- **Serverless** options (Lambda, Cloud Functions, Azure Functions) are used where appropriate to minimize idle costs.
- **CDN offloading** reduces backend load by caching global traffic.
